### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for taking the time to visit my GitHub.

All the work I've done throughout my Master's program is located in 'GuildhallSdProjects'. The projects I'd recommend checking out are:
   1. Oak Game Engine (C++).
   2. Skeletal Playground: Consisting of a skeletal animation pipeline and my Master's Thesis: Procedural Animations Using Full Body Inverse Kinematics.
   3. Math Visual Tests is also pretty fun.
