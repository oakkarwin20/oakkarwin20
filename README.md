### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for taking the time to visit my GitHub.

All the work I've done throughout my Master's program is located in 'GuildhallSdProjects'. 
Note that some projects use the fbxsdk which I did NOT upload to GitHub. The projects will work if you add the fbxsdk to engine/thirdparty

The projects I'd recommend checking out are:
   1. Oak Game Engine (C++).
   2. Skeletal Playground consists of a skeletal animation pipeline and my Master's Thesis: Procedural Animations Using Full Body Inverse Kinematics.
   3. Math Visual Tests is also pretty fun.
