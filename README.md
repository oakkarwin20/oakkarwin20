### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for taking the time to visit my Github.

Here's a brief roadmap of the projects in my repo:
1. Muffin Clicker
    a. This was my first project I ever made to start learning programming. This project is a game where you keep track of the number of times players click on the muffin in the center of the game. 
    b. This game was made in C#.
2. Tic Tac Toe
    a. My attempt to remake Tic Tac Toe in C++ using only the output window.
3. Rock Paper Scissors
    a.  My attempt to remake Rock Paper Scissors using only the output window.
